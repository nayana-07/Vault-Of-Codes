      <h3>A light weight secure auditing scheme for shared data in cloud storage</h3>
      <p>This project aims to develop a lightweight and secure auditing scheme specifically designed for shared data within cloud storage environments. The scheme will enable efficient verification of data integrity by authorized users or a third-party auditor without incurring significant computational overhead. It will also incorporate security mechanisms to protect the confidentiality and privacy of the shared data during the auditing process.</p>

      <h3>Bone Fracture Detection</h3>
      <p>This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to automatically detect bone fractures from medical images like X-rays. The goal is to create a system that can accurately identify the presence and location of fractures, potentially aiding medical professionals in faster and more reliable diagnoses. By leveraging convolutional neural networks and large datasets of labeled images, the project aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of fracture detection in clinical settings.</p>
